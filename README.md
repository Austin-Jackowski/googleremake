My name is Austin and I am currently learning front-end web development.
My original degree is in Biomedical Science from York University, and I am trying to switch careers. I've always been analytical, and enjoy planning and researching before embarking on projects. I am creating this remake of the google homepage as a test to myself, as I am trying to use as many developer tools as I can:

I am running all of my projects from a VM using VBox as I didn't want to create a dual-boot setup.
